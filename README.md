# Introduction to Computer Security

## Course Overview

This course focuses on computer security fundamentals, the main concepts, terms and principles. Students will learn to understand what computer security is (and is not), learn threats, vulnerabilities and attacks, principles of practical and provable security,  and get hands-on experience with common security features.
The course is lectured in [Tomsk State University](http://en.tsu.ru).
